  <p>Your first assignment is to create a website on anything that is of interest to you. (Within reason :) The website will need to have minimum of 3 web pages. This means that you have an index page that will link to other pages and vice versa. 
  The key for this website to be a success is for you being able to demonstrate that you have used key design principles to create your site.</p>
  <a name="start"><h3>Creating Web Pages Using HTML</h3></a>
  <p>First create a new folder called Webpages and inside the folder create new web pages file called Mypage1.html and Mypage2.html etc.</p>
  <p>Open the file Mypage1.html in Notepad (programs  accessories  notepad) and write HTML code in the file. </p>
  <p>To find how to write HTML code read the tutorial and websites:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><%= link_to 'W3 Schools',  "http://www.w3schools.com/html/DEFAULT.asp" %></li>
    <li><%= link_to 'Web Monkey', "www.webmonkey.com" %></li>
    <li><%= link_to 'HTML Goodies', "www.htmlgoodies.com" %></li>
  </ul>
  <a name="must"><h3>Your web pages must include the following elements: </h3></a>
  <ul class="align_text">
    <li>&nbsp Title / Header in all the pages</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp Headings in all the page</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp Reasonable amount of text in all the page</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp Pictures</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp Link to a web site on www [External Links]</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp Link to Mypage2.html and Mypage3.html [Internal Links]</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp Link to inside Mypage1.html (eg. Top or bottom of page) [Inline Links]</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp A list [at least one]</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp A table [at least one]</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp References from where you took pictures and text [Source must be provided]</li><br />
    <li><font>&nbsp Please note that proper nesting of tags is a must</font></li><br />
    <li>&nbsp Cascading Style Sheet (CSS):  The CSS should define the style of your webpages. All design elements used on your website should be defined and controlled via the CSS</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp JavaScript: The purpose of Javascript is to add interactivity to your webpages. You must be able to demonstrate that you have incorporated at least 2 Javascript scripts within your website</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp Your lecturer and practical teacher will assist you with these concepts and how best to use them within your website. <font>Use of any software which aids in developing a website carries severe penalty</font></li><br />
  </ul>
  <a name="report"><h3>Report</h3></a>
  <ul class="align_text">
    <li>Part of the assignment is to write a report [600 - 1000 words] answering the questions specified below.</li><br />
    <li>&nbsp Explain why you chose the CSS styles (color, font, spacing, theme, navigation, images, background) that you did. Discuss whether they make your website 'user friendly'</li>
    <li>&nbsp If your technological ability were limitless, what else would you want to do with this web site? How would it look, what features would it have? How would it communicate better who you are and / or what you believe in</li>
    <li>&nbsp Find one other web site that you admire and provide the URL. What specific elements do you think are admirable about the site (Design? Content? Layout? Overall impression? Cool technology?</li>
  </ul>
  <a name="sub"><h3>Submission</h3></a>
  <p>For your submission you will need your Twitter account. By now you would have added to your Twitter list your practical teacher's Twitter account. You will need to send a direct message to your practical teacher (not a 'tweet') with your final webpage link, your full name and StudentID before your practical class before the 16th Jan 2012 Your practical teacher will go through the assignment with you (in person) in the practical session also.</p>
  <a name="mark"><h3>Marking</h3></a>
  <p>Marks in this assignment are gained in two categories. <p>
  <p>The first category is the technical component of the assignment. Your website will be evaluated against the requirements specified above. Marks awarded are directly proportional to the amount of effort that is spent on the assignment. This means that you must spend extra time researching about html, css and javascript. Also remember that developing the website with 3 webpages is only a minimum specification. Note that in some cases half marks may be awarded.</p>
  <p>The second category is the ability to explain and discuss the submission. Your practical demonstrator will ask you questions about your submission and marks will be awarded on the basis of your ability to answer them. This section will always include an oral discussion with the demonstrator and will include a written discussion (You can consider the Report to be the main basis on your mark awarded for this category for Assignment 1).</p>
  <p>Note: We are serious about the requirement in the explanation and discussion category. It is not easy to obtain full marks in this category - only the very best students will do so.</p>
